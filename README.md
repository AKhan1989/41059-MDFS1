Once you've finished cloning your repository to the local computer do the following:

To test the git add, git commit, git push functions use the "test.txt" file. 
1. Create a change with your name and student number in the test.txt file from your local computer.
2. Then open your terminal and follow the tutorial I've uplioaded on teams
3. To check if you did upload your change, open the test.txt file from github and not from your local computer. Alternatively ask someone to open it and see if they can see the changes you've made
